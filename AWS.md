## AWS Tutorial: Basics to Advanced

### 1. Compute

|Category|Service|Descri­ption|
|---|---|---|
|Instances(Virtual machines)|EC2|Web-scale cloud computing is simplified using It.|
|EC2 Spot|Up to 90% off fault-tolerant workloads are run by using this.|
|EC2 Autosc­aling|To meet changing demand, automatically add or remove compute capacity.|
|Lightsail|To create & operate a virtual private server with AWS using the simplest method available. A cloud platform that includes everything you need to create an application or website.|
|Batch|Allows developers, scientists, and engineers to create and run hundreds of thousands of batch processing jobs on Amazon Web Services (AWS)|
|Containers|Elastic Container Service (ECS)|A scalable, secure, and highly efficient way to run containers.|
|Elastic Container Registry (ECR)|You can store, manage, and deploy container images easily.|
|Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)|A fully managed service.|
|Fargate|Its is used as Serverless compute for containers|
|Serverless|Lambda|Pay only for the compute time you consume, instead of running code without thinking about servers.|
|Edge and hybrid|Outposts|You can have a truly consistent hybrid experience with AWS infrastructure and services on your own premises.|
|Snow Family|Formalise, process, and store data in rugged or disconnected edge environments.|
|Wavelength|It is used to deliver ultra-low latency applic­ation in devices using 5G|
|VMware Cloud on AWS|Work faster by innovating faster, rapidly shifting to the cloud, and securely working from anywhere.|
|Local Zones|It runs latency-sensitive applic­ations closer to the end-users.|
### 2. Storage

|Service|Description|
|---|---|
|AWS S3|S3 is a distributed database that is connected to every device in the network through the Internet. It uses a peer-to-peer model, meaning that data is not stored on a central server. Instead, data is stored directly between the user and the service that the user is trying to access. This provides a faster and more reliable service than a traditional database would because it does not have to be transferred when a change is made.|
|AWS Backup|AWS Backup automates the entire backup process from storage to delivery — removing the need to manually input and process backup data. It provides end-to-end encryption of your backup data to help keep your data secure. AWS Backup is a highly efficient and cost-effective way to protect your business data.|
|Amazon EBS|Amazon Elastic Block Store provides block-level storage volumes. These storage volumes are created and managed from the web service's dashboard and can be used to backup your application data and store your logs. By providing storage volumes for your applications, you can create a controlled, low-­cost way to backup your application data and store your application logs in the cloud. You can also use the Elastic Block Store as a way to automatically rotate your application data to prevent data loss in the case of a hard or software failure.|
|Amazon EFS Storage|EFS is a blob Storage. Amazon EC2 instances can store files in EFS. You can think of it as a hosting service that offers you cloud storage for free. You can store any type of file with this cloud storage, and it's very fast. You can get up to 2 TB storage for free. You can increase this storage limit by purchasing more space. EFS provides an option to encrypt your files.|
|Amazon FSx|FSx for Windows Server and Lustre (fully managed high-performance file systems built on Windows Server) offer native compatibility and characteristic sets for workloads. FSx for Windows Server (favourite storage built on Windows Server) and Lustre (favourite file system integrated with S3) are available as FSx for Windows Server.|
|AWS Storage Gateway|A storage gateway enables an on-premise software appliance to communicate with cloud-based storage. It provides an edge-­led, no-­premium, high-­speed connection between the software and storage provider, allowing for a more cost-­effective and efficient delivery of software and data to customers. The service can be accessed via a mobile device or web browser and eliminates the need for customers to maintain large, expensive on-premises data centres. Some of the benefits of using a data centre as opposed to a cloud provider include lower costs, longer operational flexibility due to lower operational costs, and availability of human resources for support. A data centre can be more than just a place to park servers. It can be a hub for other business processes, enabling a higher level of integration between the data and the applications that generate it.|
|AWS DataSync|DataSync is simple and efficient data transfer between on-premises storage and S3, EFS, or FSx for Windows File Server. DataSync can also be used to migrate your on-premises data to S3 and other cloud storage providers. DataSync offers both a server software and client software option. With the client software, you can create a disconnected storage pool and then connect the server to the storage pool using DataSync. With the server software, you can create a disconnected storage pool and then connect the storage pool to the on-premises data hub using DataSync.|
|AWS Transfer Family|Transfer Family is designed to provide seamless file transfers into & out of S3.|
|AWS Snow Family|Snow Family devices are highly­-sec­ured, port­able com­puters that collect and trans­mit data at the edge, and migrate data between AWS and other systems.|

| Wide column          | Fleet management system                    | Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra)    | Keyspacesis is designed to be used in tandem with Apache Cassandra as the primary database for high-throughput workloads. The key to using Key­ Spaces is the isolation of data between the different applications that use it. The data is held in a single database instance, but applications can use different databases (such as Redis or CouchDB) to store their data in a different system. Key­ Spaces is a highly available database service, which means that if there is a failure in the primary database, other key­ spaces can continue to operate with minimal impact to the application. |

### 12. Serverless

|Category|Service|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Compute|Lambda|Lambda is a cloud-based service that functions as a sort of middleman. Data flows through the middleman and is processed at a data centre of your choice. The code running on the server is only responsible for processing request data, not generating it. This code is called the “backend” and is what most people think of when they think of “serverless.” It’s not a “server” at all. The code running on the serverless platform is purely “blackbox” in that it does not know what data it receives and it does not manage or store any of the data it receives or emit any data of its own. The backend code receives requests from clients and processes them accordingly.|
|Lambda­@Edge|Amazon CloudFront provides Lambda­@Edge, which allows you to run code closer to users of your application, which improves performance and reduces latency.|
|Fargate|Refer to the containers section. It has already been explained there.|
|Storage|S3|Refer to the storage section. It has already been explained there.|
|EFS|Refer to the storage section. It has already been explained there.|
|Data stores|DynamoDB|DynamoDB is a NoSQL database that is designed to work with JavaScript. It is a highly scalable database that can be used to store huge amounts of data and still be fast. As more data is added to the database, the performance of the database also increases. In order to use this database, you must first create a database account and sign up for a free trial.|
|Aurora Serverless|Aurora Serverless is a serverless computing platform that eliminates the need for manually managing infrastructure and automates critical steps of a serverless infrastructure implementation, such as creating a config­uration blueprint and selecting a provider. It helps you scale your software without scaling infrastructure. You can use Serverless to create an entire development and test environment, or you can use it to create a production-level application with the same codebase and same data, with the same engineers, testing in the same environment, and deployments across the same clusters.|
|RDS Proxy|The RDS Proxy can be used to: <br><br>Manage a single database across multiple clusters<br><br>Reduce costs by reducing the number of nodes in your RDS infrastructure<br><br>Enable high availability of your RDS clusters<br><br>Enable self managed storage for your RDS clusters<br><br>Speed up your application deployments|
|API Proxy|API Gateway|API Gateway works with any language or platforms that can communicate with the Google Cloud Platform.

It is a perfect fit for growing businesses or teams that need to build and manage an API programmatically.|
|Applic­ation integr­ation|SNS|SNS facilitates the exchange of data between apps and devices using standardized APIs. You can create SNS topics and send and receive messages using SNS clients and servers. SNS provides security and control over messages that are not tagged with certain topics or sent from certain clients. With SNS, you can: Send and receive messages with a simple interface Control which devices can send messages, who can read them, etc. Access and view messages and conversations from different clients & devices at the same time.|
|SQS|With SQS, you can send messages between applications and services, route them to the right recipient, and keep track of the source & target addresses. It’s similar to Slack or Hipchat but it’s not a replacement for those popular chatting apps. SQS is a message queuing solution that enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, & serverless applications.|
|AppSync|It's simple to create GraphQL APIs with AppSync, which handles the hard work of securely connecting to data sources such as AWS DynamoDB, Lambda.|
|EventB­ridge|It is a low-cost alternative to building a new backend infrastructure for every new app. With Serverless EventB­ridge, you can connect your existing apps with a few lines of code. You don’t have to build a new backend for every new app you want to connect to. You can use existing infrastructure as a provider of event data, and connect your apps using Serverless EventB­ridge.|
|Orches­tration|Step Functions|Step Functions is an easy-to-use function orchestra that makes it possible to string Lambda functions and multiple AWS services into business-critical applications.|
|Analytics|Kinesis|Kinesis enables one to get timely insights by collecting, processing, and analyzing real-time, streaming data.|
|Athena|Athena provides a high-level language that allows users to quickly and easily set up and operate their S3 data analysis. With Athena, you can view data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL queries. This allows you to save time by not having to learn a new data analytics software.|
### 13. Application Integration
