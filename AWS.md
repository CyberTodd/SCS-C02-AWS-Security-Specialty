# Service Features in Detail

### üõ° **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

- **Least Privilege**: Assign only the permissions needed.
    
- **MFA Enforcement**: Deny actions unless `aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent` is true.
    
- **Policy Conditions**: Enforce HTTPS (`aws:SecureTransport`) or encryption usage.
    
- **Resource-Level Permissions**: Supported in many services (e.g., S3), **not** in RDS.

### IAM Roles 

- IAM roles have **temporary credentials** (STS tokens), unlike long-lived IAM users with access keys.
- You can **limit session duration** (as short as 15 minutes) and even enforce **MFA at assume-role time**.
- If credentials are compromised, the **short lifetime greatly reduces blast radius**.

### IAM Policies

- They control access to KMS keys

### Security Groups

- Security Groups are stateful, meaning that if you allow inbound traffic, the return is automatically allowed
- It's best practice to explicitly define both inbound and outbound rules for better control
- Default security groups may allow all outbound traffic, but you should adjust them as needed to minimize risks

---

### üîê **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**

- **CMKs (Customer Managed Keys)**: Required for strict compliance and control.
    
- **Key Rotation**: Automatically rotate keys annually.
    
- **Integrated With**: S3, RDS, EBS, Lambda, Secrets Manager, etc.
- SSE-KMS supports specifying a cross-account CMK ARN
- KMS key policies control access to the KMS key itself and take precedence over IAM policies
- To ensure **only a specific IAM role** can use the key for encryption and decryption, you need to explicitly **allow access** to that role in the **key policy**

### Secrets Manager Resource Policies

- Are the primary way to limit access to a specific principal (like a Lambda IAM role)
- Enforces principle of least privilege
- Strong protection from human access

---

### üìÅ **Amazon S3**

- **Encryption at Rest**:
    
    - **SSE-S3**: Amazon-managed keys
        
    - **SSE-KMS**: Use with CMKs for compliance
        
- **Block Public Access**: Must-have for securing buckets
    
- **Bucket Policies**: Enforce HTTPS, MFA, encryption
- S3 Server Access Logging logs who accessed what, when, and from where    
- **CloudTrail Data Events**: Enables access auditing
- S3 Object Lock - WORM (Write Once - Read Many) protection also prevents deletion or overwrite of objects even by root/ admin - also is perfect for compliance frameworks

---

### üß† **AWS Secrets Manager**

- **Automatic Rotation**: Built-in support for RDS, Aurora, Redshift, etc.
    
- **Fine-grained IAM Access**
    
- **KMS Integration**: Encrypt secrets with CMKs
    
- **CloudFormation Support**: Via **dynamic references**
    
- **Logging Access**: Through **CloudTrail**
    

---

### üßæ **AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Parameter Store**

- **SecureString** type supports encryption with KMS
    
- **No native rotation** unless custom setup is used
    
- Can be referenced in CloudFormation, but lacks built-in rotation
    

---

### üìú **AWS CloudTrail**

- **Logs all API activity** (control plane + optional data events) for auditing, storing, and extended retention
    
- **Data Events**: Needed to track access to objects in S3 or records in RDS/Secrets Manager
    
- **Compliance**: Used to retain logs for auditing and investigations

---

### üóÑ **Amazon RDS**

- **Encryption at Rest**: Use KMS with CMKs
    
- **SSL/TLS**: Encrypt data in transit
    
- **No resource-level IAM**: Control fine-grained access at the DB level (e.g., GRANTs)
    

---

### üíª **AWS Lambda**

- **Least Privilege Role Per Function**
    
- **Secrets Access**: Should use Secrets Manager, not env vars
    
- **Encrypted Env Vars**: Still exposed to those with view access
    
- **Logging & Auditing**: CloudTrail for API activity
- Grant s3:PutObject permission to Lambda function on S3 to grant minimum necessary permissions for accessing S3 while being securely confined within a VPC

---

### üëÅ‚Äçüó® **Amazon Macie**

- **Discover/classify** PII in **S3**
    
- **Not** used for blocking access or database fields
    

---

### üõ° **AWS Shield Advanced**

- **DDoS protection**, **not** involved in encryption or secrets
    

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **AWS CloudFormation**

- **Dynamic References**: Fetch secrets from Secrets Manager or SSM securely
    
- **Avoid plaintext secrets** in templates or source code
- Supports **automatic rotation**, **encryption with CMKs**, and **access control**.
```CloudFormation
{{resolve:secretsmanager:secret-name:SecretString:json-key::}}
```
- This solution is **purpose-built**, secure, and integrates directly with CloudFormation.

### API Gateway

- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** ensures that **only known clients** with **valid certificates** can connect (strong client authentication)
- **Lambda authorizers** enable **custom auth logic**, potentially using **tokens**, IP checks, org identity, etc.

### NAT (Network Address Translation) Gateway

- access the internet from a private subnet
- access your network using allow-listed IP addresses
- enable communication between overlapping networks

### GuardDuty

- Detects threats: EC2 credential compromise, Port scans, malware, anomalous API calls
- Combine it with EventBridge + Lambda automation to quarantine EC2 instances by modifying Security Groups, NACLs (Network Access Control Lists), or stopping instances
- Alert SOC teams in real time
- Integrates with Security Hub, which acts as a centralized alert aggregator

### SCP - Service Control Policies

- Allows you to enforce org-wide guardrails
- By using **conditions like `aws:RequestTag` or `aws:ResourceTag`**, you can block access **unless a session or resource is explicitly marked** as secure (e.g., with `Environment=Production`).
- Helps **limit the blast radius** by **scoping where and when credentials can be used**.
- **SCPs apply even if a user has full IAM permissions** ‚Äî so they‚Äôre excellent for protecting against credential misuse across accounts.

### VPC Peering
- Allows you to securely connect two VPCs and route traffic between them, without going through the public internet
- This is ideal for communication between different layers of your architecture, such as web and database tiers, without exposing them to public access
- It provides a private, high-speed, and secure connection between subnets in different VPCs or within the same VPC
